            We work with monitoring programmes to ensure compliance with safety,
            health and quality standards for our products. The Green to Wear 2.0
            standard aims to minimise the environmental impact of textile
            manufacturing.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            To that end, we have developed Inditexâ€™s The List programme, which
            helps guarantee both that production processes are clean and that
            our garments are safe and healthy.
